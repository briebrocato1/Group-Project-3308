# Group-Project-3308
Application Description: 
We are creating an interactive database of rock-climbing routes in the Boulder area. We hope to create a website catered to college students interested in climbing, with options to find new routes and climbing partners, leave reviews for others, and more. 
Our site will include a full database of climbs in the Boulder area pulled from MountainProject. Climbers will be able to add their own routes, provided they have proper documentation of the climbs.
