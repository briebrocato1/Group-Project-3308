# Group-Project-3308
Application Description: 
We are creating an interactive database of rock-climbing routes in the Boulder area. We are creating a website catered to college students interested in climbing, with the ability to browse local routes, search for specific routes, view a message board, and create user profiles. Once logged into their profile, users will be able to add new routes, review/rate routes, post to the message board, and find climbing partners.  
Our site will include a full database of climbs in the Boulder area pulled from MountainProject. Climbers will be able to add their own routes, provided they have proper documentation of the climbs.
