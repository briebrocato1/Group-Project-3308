Like all routes on Pyramid, there is plenty of loose rock and tricky route finding; however, for competent rock climbers, this is an easy scramble.  If you follow your nose and stay on route, the route is fairly tame. This is a fairly short climb, by 14er standards, only about 8 miles of hiking round-trip; however, there is a great deal of scree & talus hopping, making progrss slow & tedious.  This is an alpine summit, so be prepared to deal with altitude, extreme weather, etc. Begin at Maroon Lake, ~10 miles SW of Aspen.  Follow the trail towards Crater Lake, for ~ 1 mile.  The trail heads along Maroon Lake, then up a steep hill in the woods.  The trail pops out of the woods, and follows a classic moraine for several hundred yards.  After ~30 minutes (from the parking lot) there is an enormous cairn on the left marking the new trail to Pyramid Peak.  Turn left and follow this trail. The Pyramid Peak trail begins fairly flat, heading SE across the ancient glacial valley.  After ~ 5 minutes, the trail hits the valley wall and begins switchbacking up the steep slope.  The trail crosses a number talus fields on its way up to the North Face Cirque.  After about 30 minutes of steep hiking, the trail ends at the mouth of an enormous talus filled cirque.  This is the North Face Cirque.  The impressive N face of pyramid is visible. Hike due south into the cirque, which probaly has some snow fields.  Follow the snow where its safe to do so, otherwise hug the right side of the cirque, following an intermittent cairned trail.  After a tedious, steep climb up, a broad plateau is reached, just below the N Face.  The NW Ridge splits off here.  For the NE ridge, head L (WSW), hopping talus across the basin, aiming for the west wall of the cirque. Likely the least pleasant section of the route climbs the steep west wall of the cirque via a series of scree-filled couloirs.  There is a well beaten trail leading to the correct couloir, and there should be a number of large cairns.  Follow this couloir to about half-way up the face, then traverse up & right to the next couloir, which is followed to the top of the wall, to the Northeast Ridge.  There is plenty of loose rock in this couloir, so wear a helmet and take care not to knock rocks down on climbers below. Once atop the wall, follow the Northeast Ridge towards the summit.  This route is well cairned, and well-beaten.  If you find yourself on untrampled ground, you are off-route. The first section of the ridge climbs more or less directly on the ridge, with a few short diversions onto the N (right) side of the ridge.  Eventually the route turns to the S side of the ridge, and from this point stays to the S pretty much until the summit.  The route winds up and down, left & right.

('Skyline Traverse', '5.6', 'X', false, false, false, false, false, false, 'Unknown', 'It''s the Denver Skyline! I''ve always loved point-to-point excursions. Living in the Denver area, I''ve always looked at the skyline and wondered what it would be like to climb the entire thing in one go, and just stay on The Divide. I could get dropped off at Milner Pass in the North, stay The Divide all the way to the next road at Berthoud Pass. Having not climbed or researched any of the mountains on this route, I was unfamiliar with what such an adventure would entail. Finally last year, I decided to check it out. I embarked on the journey not knowing what to expect, if anyone had ever done it, or if it was even possible. I assumed there would be some scrambling involved, but by the time I got to McHenry''s notch, I realized a couple of things. One, I was in for a much bigger adventure than I had anticipated, and two, there was no way I''d be able to climb every bump and gendarme that happened to be on the divide, so I settled for summitting every named peak along the way. On day two, I ran into a couple of guys doing another traverse called the NULLLA FreewayNULL, who asked if I was doing Pfiffner's, but I didn''t know what that was. When they understood what I was attempting, they informed me that they had in fact attempted this link-up themselves, but as far as they knew, it had never been completed. By the time I got to Paiute Peak, I was halfway done but out of time. I had only allotted 3 days off of work, so I would have to try again. My approach this year was different. Instead of an ultra-fast approach, I planned for 5 days on the trek, knowing I would be slogging it out with difficult climbing and challenging route-finding. My wife dropped me off at 5:30 AM, and I departed into the dark forest following The Continental Divide. The slog up to Mt. Ida was easy Class 1 easy hike to Cracktop. I had missed this one last year, since it was technically just off The Divide, but I figured I''d include it. Then Hayden Spire was next. It too was off The Divide, by a little more, but this one looked like a fun climb. I decided to see where my head was at and see if I could figure this one out, but I left the pack behind. It proved to be a nice, micro-sized challenge for the upcoming objectives. I was able to 4th Class my way over the ridge to the overhanging headwall, considered climbing it, but then found the easier weakness on the right side of the spire clocking in around 5.4. More easy hiking took me over Sprague Mt., Knobtop and Notchtop. I slogged through Ptarmigan Pt., Flattop, up Hallett, Otis, and a long way to Taylor, setting up camp on the summit. A pack of coyotes sounded way too close, their howls and yelps bouncing off the canyon walls nearby. I was glad to be bivvied at the summit. Day 2, time to climb, super nervous. After ascending Powell Peak, I headed down the other side and the Class 1 terrain suddenly gave way to 5th Class ridge scrambling, and downclimbing. This was the part that had shocked me last year, and I found myself equally filled with fear this year. As I continued descending down cliff after cliff, I felt committed. At the final cliff, I found a series of descending ledges trending left, ending in a 60' 5.3 face climb. Now I was at the notch. 4th Class gullies to the right led me up the south side of McHenry''s to the summit. 3rd Class took me down to Stoneman Pass, through a sea of gendarmes up to Chiefshead. Uneventful 2nd and 3rd Class through Mt. Alice to Tanima. The Cleaver was easy 3rd Class. Then the difficulties ramped up again to climb Isolation. After the Cleaver, one encounters an overhanging headwall that cliffs out in both directions. Last year I traversed right for several hundred feet down to a 3rd Class gully system which led back up to the summit ridge eventually but wasted a lot time. This year I decided to tackle the headwall straight on. There''s a large cliff on the right following exposed 5.4 crack systems straight up, eventually leading out left to 4th Class to a long set of false summits before finding the true summit of Isolation Peak. The difficulties eased up for a while through Ouzel and Ogalalla, where I camped on the summit for night 2. Day 3 started with easy hiking through Ooh La La, 12228, 12930, and Sawtooth. Enroute to Paiute. Things took a dramatic turn again, and I spent several hours navigating gendarmes and 4th/5th scrambling to arrive at the base of Paiute Peak. A 4th Class scramble led to the headwall where I traversed right for 100 feet or so and climbed directly up the cliff at about 5.5 for maybe 100' before things tapered off to 4th Class to the summit. There may be a way to bypass these difficulties by continuing to traverse right. More easy ridge scrambling to Mt. Toll. I traversed right up 4th Class to a ledge system where one encounters a series of short 5th Class cliffs broken up by ledge systems. One is the technical crux at around 5.6, but the exposure is very manageable. 4th Class to summit. 2nd/3rd Class to Pawnee and then Shoshoni. Here things got quite challenging for me navigating the Chessmen. I managed to stay on The Divide until the last formation but accidentally climbed the last Chessman, hoping for a ridge-connect to Apache, but there were just rap slings and an impossible cliff. So, I downclimbed about 600' to a ledge that crossed a small snowfield left of the Chessmen and across to a gully that took me up to the Apache summit where I bivvied for night 3. Day 4, easy scrambling to Navajo. 4th Class and easy 5th took me up the right side of Navajo. From a distance, I sensed that Arikaree would not be climbable up the North face in either direction, so I took a low sweep left to catch its left flank which turned out to be an exciting 4th Cass scramble to the summit. From there to Deshawa, my route-finding abilities were challenged again through exposed 4th Class scrambling, but I was able to stay on the divide. Eventually I encountered a crashed airplane on the left side of the mountain. I had to scramble through broken plane debris up 4th Class eventually leading to the summit of Deshawa. After this, the ridge became more dramatic. Around halfway to North Arapaho, I bailed from the ridge down to the Arapaho Glacier, as things were beginning to look unclimbable. I climbed the bergschrund until I was forced to cross the glacier. I grabbed a couple spikes of rock and traversed the 30 degree snow slope to attain the gully and a huge slog up to the summit of North Arapaho. The 4th Class ridge scramble to South Arapaho is solid and well-traveled. Heading directly down to Arapaho Pass was steep and loose. It kept looking like it would cliff out, but I kept traversing right until I found a small gully down to the notch. This is where a thunderstorm hit, and I hid under a cave hearing lightning crashing around me. As the storm relented a bit, I reluctantly trudged up the well traveled trail past Arapaho Pass and up to the ridge scramble to get to Neva. About halfway through the ridge, the weather turned nice. Here, for the first time, the rock felt solid and relatively safe. I camped the night at the summit of Jasper. Day 5, I never would have expected to be able to go all the way to Berthoud Pass. My progress had been slow and mentally exhausting to this point, but I began hiking through glorious Class 1 terrain to Skyscraper Peak and then eventually began picking up trail systems off and on through Rollins Pass, Rogers Pass, and right up James Peak. It was only 1 pm, unbelievable. I realized for the first time that I was going to make Berthoud Pass that night, so I made plans for my wife to pick me up at 6. From here, a long scramble took me down and steeply up Bancroft where I encountered another storm.

This was one of the most intense adventures I''ve had in a long time due to the sheer duration I had to keep fear in check and maintain focus on climbing and navigation, most of which came from a fear of the unknown, but then again, that was part of the adventure! From a broad perspective, the beauty of the idea of going road to road and tackling all that came in between was the objective, and it''s a cool feeling to have walked the 'catwalk in the clouds', staying right on the true Continental Divide, above treeline the entire way, looking down at distant alpine lakes and snowfields going on forever, remaining on the perpetual summit for 71 miles. What an amazing journey! Notes: This entire project was done onsight. Besides Neva Peak, I had done no research on any of the climbs/ridges and had no idea if its completion was even possible. When in doubt, I tried to stay high, which was usually both the safest and the most spectacular place to be. The section between Powell Peak and Neva Peak requires intense navigational/route-finding skills and should prove to be sufficiently engaging for any alpinist.

Also, overbearing MP admins should really stop ghost editing things they have no business editing. I am doing a disservice to this site by adding the Moron''s Bells Traverse, otherwise called the Megamoronal Traverse. Let''s be honest. It is quite possibly the most idiotic chossfest on here. Why am I adding it? Quite simply, because some of you are idiots. What''s better than the Red, Rugged, and Rotten Cocktail for a full 20 miles and 12,000 feet of gain, constantly dodging loose rock and yarding off widow makers above the abyss? Not much. Unfortunately, and I don''t mean to be rude, but you probably aren''t capable of doing this route. To be somewhat candid. It''s too long, too loose, too pointless, too complicated, and so forth, but here it is, for the moronically inclined: The goal of the traverse is to run the ridge, tagging the points >13K feet surrounding Minnehaha Gulch and West Maroon Creek, starting at Buckskin Pass and ending at Pyramid. Yes, the ridge goes with some high bypassing, and for those who THINK they''re in shape enough to attempt this, it goes without rope. In a day would be most impressive. The exact start and end can be modified, so long as you run the entire ridge between those two points. Also some may choose to start in Crested Butte, climb the eastern half first and then the western half, with a gear stash along the route. It doesn''t matter; whatever you choose is likely the wrong decision, since you shouldn''t be there in the first place. The passes and peaks traveled include Buckskin Pass, UN 13039, Sleeping Sexton, North Maroon, South Maroon, Belleview Mountain, West Maroon Pass, UN 13130 (the true summit is actually SE of the ridge), UN 13180B, UN 13722 (NULLLightning PyramidNULL), Thunder Pyramid, and, finally, Pyramid Peak. The logical starting place is Maroon Lake, though one attempt started outside of Crested Butte. The western half is referred to as the Megamaroonal Traverse. The eastern half is the Megamidal. A smart person, which those attempting this route most certainly are not, would scout each of those routes first to even have a chance of doing the full Moron''s in a day. The crux of the Megamaroonal section is Sleeping Sexton to the Gunsight prior to North Maroon. The key is to find a good ledge - generally on the W side - bypassing cliffs on the ridge. One should be able to stay fairly close to the ridge. The downclimbing is tricky, perhaps 5.easy for the most savy route-finders. The North Maroon to Maroon downclimb is much easier and cleaner in comparison. Watch out for the more dangerous choss between Maroon and Belleview. The 5.4 crux of the Megamidal is Thunder Pyramid to Pyramid, a rather exposed chimney system on the east side of the ridge. Other than that, expect some rather intense route-finding and numerous sections of exposed 3rd, 4th, and low 5th scrambling. Describing the route is near impossible, and the route should be reserved for confident and experienced terrain navigators. Luckily, there are numerous bail spots, and it would behoove you to know where they are, since you''re likely to use one.

I''d like to make the point that most routes on this wall, not just Undertow, are unusually dangerous. Alcoves usually form within cliffs located under plateaus, like we see in Canyonlands.  The flat surface above the cliff collects groundwater, the water weakens the rock, and the wet zone weathers into an alcove.  Most alpine cliffs have only small summits above and dry quickly.  Climbers know the Black Wall has a summit plateau that soaks up water like a sponge, taking days or weeks to dry out. Compare the dripping rim of the Black Wall to the once familiar and now abandoned Yosemite cliff, Glacier Point.  The largest rock avalanche off Glacier Point is proven to have been the result of a mistakenly located outhouse adding lubricant to the wall''s joints. It''s not raining poo up on Mount Evans, but a wetter wall is hard to find. What really worries me most are the vertical cracks forming Cary Granite , Good Evans , and Cannonball Corner .  These cracks increase in size, from left to right, towards the undercut center of the Black Wall. Road Warrior is widest and the little NULLJNULL at the bottom helps visualize the whole pillar as a collapse on temporary freeze-frame.  Maybe it''s time to move the belay bolts to the offwidth''s left side, so they don''t end up in the rock glacier below. Glaciers certainly delved the cirque, but this wall is so actively falling apart that any signs of glacier ice scouring it have long ago become a part of the rock glacier below.  Rock glaciers are more common under loose mountains. They abound under the rotten volcanic peaks of the San Juans.  The rock glacier below the Black Wall is not even under a peak. The talus on it is large and fresh. UNDERTOW is even closer to the alcove and the center line of the rock glacier. The route follows a large, undercut, flake, but the climbing is some of the best on the wall.  The same forces that have, and will, cause mass wasting of the Black Wall also created one heck of a steep alpine route.  Irresistible?', -105.65409, 39.6064, 'Black Wall, The'),

The gear in these seams is tricky. PITCH ONE, THE LONG REACH First ascent. It is possible to make a long reach to place a #3 Camalot in the corner''s big crack, before committing to the leftward step-across. Another big cam is handy a few moves up, before committing to a mossy, left hand jam and another big step out right to better holds.

Pitch two has a tricky step left to change cracks. There is a two bolt anchor on a dike foothold at 30 meters, handy for escaping storms. Or just use one of the bolts for pro and keep going up a beautiful dike to the top. Near the top, the nice holds thin out and the rock gets crumbly, but a bolt protects that bit. There is a third bolted rap anchor at the top of the slab. Alternatively, you can belay off fat-finger-sized cams up left on a nice ledge. 4TH CLASS TO THE TOP First ascent. I like to do one more roped pitch straight up. It is mostly very easy, but there is a final, 5.2, squeeze/bulge where a hand or finger-sized cam is nice.

It is more NULLundocumentedNULL than new. The sustained climbing and position of this route and its long pitches make it one of the best options for the Saber though. So, here I am setting aside a virtual 'page' to describe it. This set of variations climbs on or near the S. E. arete of the Saber for most of its length and every pitch is long and direct. The climbing is solid, less a few 'alpine elements' (loose rock or moss) on ledges and roofs, as would be expected for any alpine route, classic or not. This line is superior to the Kor Route and as good as the S.W. corner, which I also just did.

Climb this to its end (old fixed angle is NOT as good as it looks- tap it and watch it wiggle. Though it is buried, it is not tight by the eyes. Continue past the top of the corner in cracks a little past to reach a ledge above (5.8). Mind drag and how much rack you keep on you- this is a long pitch. Step slightly right and climb up the face for a bit into a second right-facing corner as for the S.E. Corner variation (5.10a) this one a hanging corner with a small roof below it. It ends after perhaps 10 meters. Instead of climbing left to another corner, head out right on cracks and seams around to the arete of the route. You are now on Razor''s Edge. Place gear when possible as it will not always be an option. You will pass a VERY DISTINCT 4-inch thick flake surrounded on both sides and on the 3-foot-across top by a thin finger crack. Place gear here, and make a long move upward to a very thin & delicate (perhaps 1/16NULL thick) protruding flake big enough for the tips of 3 fingers (5.10). There is a tiny fixed wire to the left of the aforementioned flakes as of 8/06. Continue up on easier terrain with ledges, and head right to a ledge with a little dirt and grass (5.8 mantle) into a short left-facing corner with a shallow right-facing corner a few meters left of you.  You can see an old, fixed, blue tricam above you in this wider crack to the left. Belay here. P4, 5.10, 170': Climb up and left to the right-facing corner with the fixed tricam. This was a NULLbail stationNULL someone had retreated from. We cleaned the webbing and biner, but the tricam was too well fixed & will likely remain unless you have a hammer. Continue up these cracks (and face where there are no cracks) within arm''s reach of the arete, sometimes grabbing and crossing it. If I recall correctly, this is the pitch with the most runouts. I passed a lot of really wide crack (5-8NULL) that would require a #6 Camalot, or the like, to protect, but the climbing was moderate, and I did not want drag, so I ran it out 50+ feet instead of wander for gear. I remained happy I did not take a truly 'big' piece because it would not have been worth it. The crux will come when on the right side you come up under a roof formed by a very thick flake, slit by a perfect handcrack. Place a 3NULL cam or #2 Camalot, and crack this crux (5.10-) to cracks above, and climb cracks to the arete. As holds run out, pull left onto the left side and belay at a horn with a fixed webbing rappel station that can be backed up with gear. The ledge here is good. P5, 5.9, ~160': Climb up and right on cracks and face around the corner, going to a shallow left facing system near the arete, continue up and right to join the corner systems of the S.E. Corner. The Kor route is somewhere to your right, still. Continue to climb up on cracks and corners for a long pitch of 5.9. I would have liked to reference your position relative to the S.E. arete of the Saber, but frankly it is not distinct here, as it is a series of corners and aretes. Gillett shows this area left of the rock''s corner, I would have expressed it as being to the right, as you can not look Westward across the South face from here. Roister refers to part of this as the NULLStepped RoofsNULL (route 21d) and draws it RIGHT of the arete on the upper half.

Continue up the corner system to the low-angle summit edge of the rock.

Which one of the 4 'shallow left facing corners' would you choose? Once found, the route requires some focus to protect and climb though we felt that pitches 2-5 were all about 1 letter grade easier than rated. All lengths given here are very approximate, as we were using unmarked ropes. P1: (5.9, ~130') From a ledge to the West (left) of the corner of the wall, go a short distance up the ramp and start up a crack, which after some distance becomes a left-facing corner system. Go up this to a good ledge below some nearly parallel cracks and belay. P1 alternate: (5.10, S, ~140') Continue up the slab further until you reach an arch of rock forming a roof. Protect on 1NULL gear, then pull the roof directly (5.10, S) and then head up and left on poor protection but good face holds (5.7, S) to the same ledge. This can be seen to the right of the line in the beta photo. F.A. Jason Haas & Tony Bubb, July 2006 P2: (5.9, ~110') Climb up on the left-most of 3 cracks that are up and just right of the belay.  The right-most of these is harder and poorly protected (5.10, S). When this runs out, head up and left on good face-holds with infrequent protection to reach another ledge. The ledge has a fixed pin with some cord on it and a knot in the crack just left of it, which has obviously been bailed from, but it needed more gear added to be trust worthy as a belay. P3: (5.10d, crux S, ~80') Climb the left-most of several cracks and corners above the belay. This pitch is closer to the arete than how we interpreted the topo proportions in Gillett''s book. We did see first of the fixed pins 40' over the ledge, though only after a few false starts. The climbing is moderate until it reaches the pin, and then beyond that a little scary and hard. The holds are sloper and require delicate climbing. The pins are difficult to back up and are not of the best quality. Be careful. Continue up the crack to a roof, where you go left and up to a ledge. Be sure to put a long sling on the final 2 pins. We got on the cracks to the right of these and found them to be largely unprotected and outright crumbling in paces before down-leading back to try the correct pitch. Avoid these. P4: (5.10c, S, 100') We combined the final two pitches together with a rope-stretching bid for the summit, relatively assured that if we fell short of it, that we''d find belay gear just before it, in the hanging corner. We made it with 2 meters of a 60M left to go.  Climb up and slightly right in a steep corner from the belay (5.9) and then up lower angle rock near the arete to go right and reach a second corner which was the second crux of the climb. Gillett calls this NULLFunky 5.10d stemmingNULL or something to that effect. It is 5.10 on bad RPs with ledges below, so bear this in mind.

('Red Face Magic', '5.8+', 'PG', false, false, false, false, false, true, 'Unknown', 'This route, which I heard about on a trip report on stephabegg.com, is a link-up of the three primary routes on Zowie and takes an amazingly direct line to the summit. The first pitch is 5.8+ and the price of admission for the rest of the route. The technical climbing is broken up by two bouts of 5.easy but allows for linking pitches with a touch of simuling while the second is on easy terrain. When I climbed the route, we combined pitches 2 and 3. There are many great belay opportunities on this route, especially on the lower half. I feel like the route is PG-13 because of the lack of pro pulling the roof on P1, especially if you don''t clip the block of death. However, the holds are huge, and a fall would be unlikely. It seems a lot of people compare Zowie to Petit. In my opinion, the average climbing quality on Petit is better, but no single pitch is better than pitches 5 or 6 on this route. The easier approach and descent to Zowie make this route a great entry park tower in my opinion, but the first pitch should not be attempted by someone only claiming to be a 5.8 leader. Descriptions below include approximate pitch lengths. Any updates with firmer numbers would be greatly appreciated. P1. Climb a prominent, left-facing dihedral system that arcs to the left at the mid-point of the pitch. As it arcs, face climbing becomes the name of the game while you protect in the crack system. This pitch is 5.8+ which lines up with what I heard about + ratings meaning NULLit''s harder than 5.8.NULL After pulling onto a ledge with rap slings, traverse around left to pull a small roof on huge jugs. Work up to a large belay ledge on 5.easy terrain on the right side of a gully. Be careful not to step on any of the many large, detached rocks here. (~150 feet, 5.8+). P2. Traverse climber''s left across the gully and work up to the base of a prominent chimney. The crux of this pitch is getting across the gully, maybe 5.3, maybe 4th Class. There is a perfect 0.4 X4-sized pod to pull onto the face for the crux move (~120 feet, 5.easy). P3. Climb the chimney working up to a squeeze. Drop your pack, and wiggle up the squeeze, finding easier ground above. I''ve seen descriptions that rate this pitch 5.6, but maybe they weren''t taking the squeeze. In my opinion, it''s every bit of 5.7 (~100 feet, 5.7). Update: avoiding the squeeze and stemming around it definitely makes P3 go at 5.6. P4. Work up more broken 5.easy terrain to the base of a small roof and corner system. This pitch is forgettable, but the rock quality is good. If you belay right above the chimney on a large ledge slightly right, there are two variations to access the easy terrain. One option is to navigate right, up, then left to a short 5.8 offwidth section. Another option is to go straight up from the belay which is generally pretty easy but has a well-protected 5.9 finger crack move before accessing the easy terrain. There is loose rock on the next pitch that is mostly avoidable but do not belay in a position where you would be directly in line with anything coming down. P5. A stellar pitch! This is what climbing on Zowie is all about. Some descriptions claim this pitch is 5.9, but I don''t believe any single move is harder than 5.7. Work up to a roof, and traverse out and around to the right, regaining the corner system and climbing a stellar hand crack to the next belay on a ledge with a giant leaning death block. The exposure at the back side of this belay is amazing, don''t forget to take in the views (~100 feet, 5.7). P6. This pitch is maybe better than pitch 5 depending on your preferred style. There are two options here, taking the offwidth to the left or a face/crack climb directly up the center of the face. Take the face option, trying to not put too much torque on the death block as you work up from the ledge. Work up the face enjoying excellent holds and great movement, belaying at the rappel anchors at the back side of the summit on climber''s right. Some descriptions say this is 5.8, but compared to the first pitch, there is no comparison (~80 feet, 5.7). Descent: rappel from bolts on the summit down to a ledge (60 feet), and walk to the north end where you will find another set of bolts. Take this rappel (80 feet) to the top of the descent gully, working down very exposed but secure 3rd Class terrain with a short scramble in the middle.

There are two options here: either the smaller, left-facing corner to climber''s left or the larger one on the right - both looked about 5.7. There was snow on the right, so we went left. This pitch had a few 5.8 moves as well as a small ledge about 50 feet from the start of the pitch that required two A1 moves: the first was a nut at the lip of the ledge, and the second was a nut just above the ledge. Once past this ledge, there was a nice belay spot about 30 feet below the ridge (one could probably climb through this short aid section at about 5.10). (Please note the original climb may have gone climber''s right up the larger corner system at 5.7 A1.) P3. Go up and left eventual gaining the ridge, easy 5.4/5.5 climbing.

This brings you to a gendarme. You end up belaying on climber''s left of the gendarme at the base of a chute/gully with multiple cracks/ridges going through it. P5. One can likely climb the chute mentioned above to climber''s left of the gendarme (we didn’t do this so not 100% it would go, but this is likely the original route). Instead we went right about 30 feet around a corner and up a large chimney that bisects the gendarme. This went at 5.7, but the rockfall hazard in the chimney was significant.

Climb about 120 feet of easy 5.4/5.5 climbing on the left of a broad ridge line to some grassy ledges below the final headwall and its very large chimney. Belay here (see the photo). P7. I would suggest splitting the final, massive chimney into two pitches due its length (200-220 feet). The chimney can be wet, for us in June it was wet and had verglas ice over half of it - perhaps later in summer there would be easier, multiple route options. Climb about 80 feet (5.6+) up to a nice belay ledge where the chimney is bisected in two by a ridge within in. P8 (crux #2) - 120 feet, 5.8. Going left of the ridge looked too steep and wet. Instead, we went to the right but had to downclimb after 30 feet due to verglas. This side couldn’t be aided (if dry and ice-free, it looked about 5.7). We instead climbed/gained the ridge in the chimney directly - starting on its right-hand side. It was a committing 5.8 move to gain the ridge without good protection (PG-13). Climb this small ridge in the chimney at 5.5/5.6 until you reach another steep section about 60 feet above the belay. Here one pulls a right-sided layback (body to right) along good but not reassuringly stable fins of rock (again 5.8, PG-13).

Music for Fingers, 5.10a, 250 feet. We took an obvious and easy left-leaning corner and ramp system on the towers northwest face. This turned out to be far and away the easiest pitch of the day. After sumitting, downclimb or hike around to your packs, and slog down to the base of the next tower. TOWER 7: Jackpot Tower The Forgotten Arete , 5.7, 550 feet. Brass in Pocket, 5.11b, 530 feet. From the base of the tower, an obvious, slabby chimney splits up the center face. Climb it for about 200 feet of easy terrain. After reaching a large ledge, traverse a bit right until underneath a large, right-leaning, right-facing dihedral (Brass in Pocket) or traverse almost 100 feet left until reaching the prow of the tower. Climb the prow to the summit over pretty consistent 5.7 face, chimney, and crack climbing. Tag the summit and hike back around to the notch between Pagoda and Tower 8, and find your way to the base of the next tower. TOWER 6: Mrs. Stubbs The Forgotten North Face , 5.8, 560 feet. Cools the Burn, 5.10a, 560 feet. From the base of Mrs. Stubbs, locate the ledge system just left of her prow. Jaunt up the ledges until the climbing begins to thin. Many easy options follow up this face through ledges, flakes, and even a hidden, low angle, splitter finger crack. Consistent 5.8 climbing drives straight up and slightly left to the towers summit. There is supposed to be a rap station on this tower, but we couldn''t find it, so we downclimbed a 5.7ish corner for 40 feet on the tower''s back side. Hike down the gully between Mr. and Mrs. Stubbs. TOWER 5: Mr. Stubbs Stubbs Fights Back, 5.11a, 250 feet. This is the obvious line that cuts straight up the center of the tower (crux) before traversing right and cruising up a large dihedral on the tower''s right side. This tower was also supposed to have a rap station on top. Unfortunately there was no obvious downclimb, so we built a two nut rap anchor of our own (7/16). Rap and hike down the gully between Mr. and Mrs. Stubbs. TOWER 4: Wind Chill Tower Cold Blooded Boys , 5.10 PG-13, 350 feet. Tag the summit, rap, and hike down the gully between Mr. and Mrs. Stubbs. TOWER 3: Dark Tower Step-in-Stien, 5.10a, 600 feet. We climbed a line that seemed to follow the exact same line as this route, but it felt much closer to 5.9 or 5.8, so we''re not sure it was exactly the same. Anyway, at the base of the prow, look for a long, large, left-facing dihedral, and follow it until it peters out. From here, climb the path of least resistance straight up the prow until hitting a large ledge with a mini-pinnacle. Traverse out right, climb up a large corner, and cruise to the top. This route may be the most consistent and enjoyable climbing of all the routes we climbed on the Keyboards. Top out, and hike down the gully between Mr. and Mrs. Stubbs. TOWER 2: Light Tower Quien Sabe Arete , 5.9, 500 feet. Hike down the gully between Towers 1 and 2. TOWER 1: Key of Free , 5.7, 800 feet. It is much easier than it looks from Tower 2 and much funner, too! Hike down the Trough back toward Green Lake.', 'Approach: hike the Glacier Gorge Trail up to Green Lake.

The Diagonal Superdirect takes this crack from its very bottom up to its top at the highpoint on Broadway which should make route finding relatively straightforward. Pitch 1. 5.11a.

It might feel a bit awkward as you get used to either your feet or hands being in the crack but typically not both. Stop at the bolted belay, 110'. Pitch 2. 5.11b.

Set a belay here (60') or head up into the overlaps at some more low 5.11 to a fixed nut belay you can backup with some cams (another 40'). The overlaps are dirty as water runs over them most of the year leaving a sandy residue.

The crack is clean here as water does not run over it. It''s gorgeous splitter seams straight out of Yoesmite. I am really not sure how it''s so smooth. The crack suddenly disappears at the obvious crux. You can place some small cams (blue and black Alien), then execute moves out left into the parallel crack, up and then back right to a stance where you can place bomber gear again back at your waist, so maybe 12' between descent gear.

This is a small, left-facing corner/flake that curves back towards the top of the off-width. This starts out easy enough, and protects well with finger-sized cams/nuts but becomes more difficult (crux) as the crack curves back left. Smear your feet and crimp on face holds to the left to easier terrain. Angle up and right another 30' or so (exactly 100') to a small, semi-hanging belay stance.

The road gets pretty rutted up towards the end, and you drive thru the Creek before the meadow; At the back of the meadow is a small parking area and an unnamed trailhead. The approach follows an old logging road which parallels West Fork Dallas Creek to its west. The North Ridge is clearly visible on the drive in until you get into the woods on the trail. The logging road is very much unmaintained and difficult to follow; full-on bushwhacking is required from the very start. The easiest path stays more or less within 100 feet parallel of the creek. A handful (hundreds and hundreds) of blowdown trees guard the approach - plan extra time for the woods. Navigate south up through the woods for about 2 1/2 miles to the base of the North Ridge. This particular route ascends the east side of the ridge, because water is available on that side. The base of the west side of the ridge is an expansive moraine of rock; no water source has been found there or in the woods to the west of the moraine. In the late spring, an incredible alpine ice route forms straight up the west face of the North Ridge. This approach in the dark is not a prudent idea; start very very early if you choose not to bivy. Bivy at the top of treeline, east of the ridge, for the smoothest approach in the morning. Bivying is recommended as finding an adequate flat patch for a tent will be strugglesome. The route starts up a steep and wide scree gully just to the east of the bottom of the ridgeline. A smaller gully further east holds a flowing creek.  Check out the source of the creek. Descent: once on the summit, follow the ridgeline to the east towards Peak 13,441. A few hundred feet below the top are several vertical fourth class steps on very loose red shale. It would be easiest to avoid these steps by descending straight south on red scree through small towers to the top of the Iron Mountain Trail; however, your camping gear is to the north. Navigate the steep steps to continue east along the summit ridge: exposed fourth-class circumnavigation on the south side, or direct downclimbing through the loose rock for thirty or so (give or take) feet. The goal being to eventually descend north off of the East Ridge onto the expansive scree field shelf below, and down to the scree gully first ascended in the morn. This is achieved by continuing to traverse along the summit ridge east towards Peak 13,441 to a low point approximately 3/4 miles from Mears' summit. From this low point in the ridge, downclimb south through loose rock bands onto the prodigious scree shelf. From here, trend west across the rocks to the top of the initial steep and wide scree gully above camp which has the 'scree cornice' at its top.', -107.86365, 38.01073, 'Mears Peak'),

Among the ideas expressed was that an innate fear of certain animals was evolutionarily bred into the human mind. The dangerous animals of the time, these 'Dragons Of Eden' became frighting creatures to man as a matter of biology not a matter of conditioning. This was later demonstrated in experiments with Chimps, by way of 'conditioning' the subject species to be fearful of both snakes and bunnies by showing mildly fearful reactions of other chimps to the stimuli. Young apes were easily conditioned to be fearful of snakes, but not of rabbits. The conclusion being that the tendency to fear snakes is innate, but not rabbits.

Stem up a few moves (crux, optional #4 Camalot) to reach a 1.5NULL -2NULL crack (excellent pro).  Be sure to protect with long slings to avoid drag.  There is a hidden 2-finger pocket inside the O.W. pod that keeps the grade reasonable and climbing secure.  Pull over the bulge on a solid jam and jugs, wandering slightly left, then up for a ways to reach good pro behind a flake on a small ledge (long slings) before heading back right and onto a large ledge, perhaps 20 meters up.

Continue by going up and left into a comfortable and fun slot/chimney with great rock, some reasonable protection, and good holds.  Belay at a small stance 30 meters over the start of the climb.  Gear for the belay was a red tricam, a 1.5NULL cam, and a #3 Camalot. P2 (5.7, 230'): Continue up the slot, exiting up and right near the top of it.

Contrary to the Rossiter book, we did not find this to be the crux once we cleaned it.  Place a few small cams overhead.  We placed a purple and a green Camalot together very high and clipped the biner to the cam loop instead of the sling.  This is important gear, as the crux to follow is dirty (chancy) and exposes you to a sideways fall to the ledge.  Undercling and pull up into a pinched flake, past feet high and right and slap and pinch your way up the overhang and get established on dirty (formerly terribly dirty) slopers and bad feet over the roof.  The end of the crux comes about when you have enough out to really hit the ledge hard - so an attentive belay is MUST.  After the crux, the climbing is downright easy, and can be protected to the summit. We cleaned this route as well as possible without a brush.  It might be in the best shape it''s been in in years right now, but it could use a good brushing yet.

This particular line starts as for the shared start of Crack Tack or Of Human Bondage . The latter of these is a book by W. Somerset Maugham and the inspiration for the now redacted name of this climb, ' Happiness in Slavery .' According to Maugham, reflecting on his life (as a free man) metaphorically as a pattern of threads in the design of fabric of a rug: NULL ...the simplest pattern, that in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died, was likewise the most perfect. NULL As for the title... Happiness in Slavery is perhaps best known in modern times as NIN song about commercialism in modern society (think: wage slave) and a term that figures prominently in ' Be Who you Want to Be ,' by Sarah Fimm, each of these dealing in similar themes and philosophical currency from another angle.   I pause to note that the music video of Happiness in Slavery has masochistic sexual content as a roughly sketched modern play of the book ' The Torture Garden ' by Octave Mirbeau, a book which which was political commentary in and of itself, on the Dryfuss Affair of late 19th century France. Although the song lyrics are not related to this, the video is. I believe that Reznor chose to do this to push the envelope with the 'Gore Hoards' and censorship, and this was his method and commentary on that. Though referred to philosophically by each of the above works, The literary origin of the route title is actually somewhat older than the songs mentioned. It was a turn of phrase specifically used in the Prelude to the book, The Story of O . As with this route title and it''s origins, that book that has nothing to do with Chattel Slavery and has a long history of being burned for the ideas it contains. How ironic, that we should end up in the same place here. Now we are into a long chain of banned or burned books, songs, videos, and route titles, but I digress.... It was never my intention, but I could not have scripted this more strangely appropriate if I had tried. As for the route itself: Climb up and onto good edges and features just right of the first bolt of Crack Tack . A couple of large stoppers and a hand-sized cam can go behind a right-facing crack/flake here just before the bolt on Crack Tack . You can skip the bolt as it is slightly further left (and you are going right), and it will create slightly more drag. The gear is good anyway. Continue up and slightly right on positive crimps and reasonably good feet. You''ll pass by the first of 2 bolts of ' Of Human Bondage ' just to the left climbing perhaps as you might as for that route. You can clip this bolt as you''ll just left of it by a meter as you reach its height, but be sure to put on a long sling if you do. If you have clipped it, it may cause some minor drag. At this point, at the height of the bolt, having clipped it (or not), you head up and left on relatively easier moves to a point that intercepts the bottom of 2 parallel seams that run up and right towards the top of the wall. Just before reaching them, I found a small/medium stopper and small cam placement. These are more directly above the previous gear placements and will make a zig-zag of the rope if you clipped the bolt on ' Bondage ; Place this gear, regardless, as it will be the gear that keeps you off the deck in a fall. Head up and to the rightmost of the two parallel, leaning seams that go to the top of the wall. They offer no gear at first, but I cleaned some rock flakes and dirt out of a spot a few meters up these and got in a grey or purple (I chose the purple, but either would work) Mastercam. I presume a purple/black Alien would also work, but those are wider, and I am not sure. A ballnut might also fit and work as a back-up piece to the cam. You''ll see the second bolt of ' Of Human Bondage ' perhaps 3 meters to your right.

The line is less technical than the one to the left (' Blind Trust ') but has longer reaches and requires harder-lockoffs. Climb up past 3 bolts to gear opportunity, mostly cams, but also a few nuts. An anchor will appear to the left, and this can be a belay if you worry about your second, or you can continue perhaps 10 meters more up and right through some choss and then back left to yet another bolted anchor.

Note, we explored left from the bolted belay but found the features rounded enough to move us rightward.  Also, you could NULLZNULL the pitch by traversing over to the tree on the left, but this inverted NULLLNULL seemed to portend less drag. P3. Now this start is probably indicated on p. 99 of Rossiter''s excellent 1999 Rock Climbing Boulder Canyon .  Avoiding the thin wire crack directly above the belay (which we dubbed the Yanukovych option), we moved slightly left into a better featured crack/groove that felt harder than 5.5.

There *IS* a reason why the route starts where it does. So start off on the right and head up and left onto a left-leaning diagonal seam and crack, heading for a right-facing open book.  You will pass a pin placement that should be backed up with an alien or other small cam.  This old ring angle is over driven, frozen by rust and levered.  Nice to have, but not trust-worthy, and the nearby gear is actually good. Clip those, and head more directly upward in an open book (questionable gear here - I bypassed it) onto a nice ledge. This part of the climb was 5.9-ish. From the ledge, one can belay or continue. Considering what is to come, you might want to belay here (optional in the book) so as to minimize the rope you have out for the next crux, which is a complete sandbag and not too far off of the ledge. From the sloping ledge, go inward to a very steep (roof/bulge), right-facing corner, and look up to a small cam placement just out of reach. You will want that clipped before pulling the next few moves, and if you are short, that will be problematic. I reached into the sharp in-cuts on the left and toe hooked into the corner hard with the right foot to gain some height and place and clip that gear before coming down to rest, which was a good idea. Gear established, work your way up through this bulge and onto the rock above it. There are some slopers, some off-angled cracks, some sidepulls, a heel-hook, etc .... I am not sure how to do this at the 5.9+ level, so I can''t give great beta.

Place solid gear before this, then top out in a brief section of offwidth through scabby rock and breath a sign of relief on top. A long cordalette  around a boulder or some creative gear sets an anchor, but you have gone up, over, and down, and the rope will run through a small crack (rounded), so the stance in and of itself is probably sufficient for a belay.

At the left of this is ' Swab The Deck' past 7 bolts in all, at the right, about 5 meters further is 'Walk the Plank.' The latter can be recognized by its starting crack which has a placement for an Alien (shallow, slightly flaring) then a #2 Camalot or #3 Friend (which takes up your good jam) before petering out, below the bottom of a shallow, left-facing dihedral that starts 20' off the ground. At he base of said dihedral, there is a placement for another Alien which is a but fussy and deep if you want it in good rock. The good-looking would-be finger locks are not so great. Be ready. Climb up from the right on a pinch to some gaston/compression moves past an Alien. If it holds a fall, you will only twist your ankles but not break your tailbone. So don''t fall. Then go up and place that 2.5-3NULL cam, then go up and place another Alien. Now the gear is great, and you are pumped. I hope you warmed up.

This can protect both ' Swab TD ; and 'Walk TP', so it deserves to be decent, but I lacked any more cord.

This certainly has an old-school charm, and the cleanliness of the route may depend upon the last time it was done before you more than anything else.  My partner and I cleaned it up a bit in fall 2011.  A little bit of everything from slab to face to crack will be encountered. While the topo in Hubbel''s book might help you locate and route find on this climb, one can not take anything therein literally or you may not be able to find the route or its pitches with any certainty or speed.  Imagining that topo as a 'generality' will be a better way to go, or else follow the description below: P1 (5.7+ awkward, 90'): Climb the right-facing corner a few feet up to a stance where multiple flakes and cracks will accept gear.  The right side will take a few consecutive pieces of hand-sized gear in bomb-proof rock.  Struggle through some awkward moves in almost a chimney-style (5.7+) and up and into lower angle terrian.  Place gear as needed with long slings and head up and right to a large shelf, passing some greenery.  Belay off of gear below a roof formed by a large boulder overhead.  The horizontal crack is bomber for belay gear. P2 (5.9, 110'): After undoing the first belay, move over and right and re-stack the rope below a slightly left-leaning crack and flare that goes up to a roof that goes up and right.  There are some small plants and grass in the flare that make it hard to see what gear is needed, but some appears about every time you want it and certainly every time you NEED it.  This may be PG-13 due to the awkwardness of protecting it, but it is not R.  Hubbel''s topo for this pitch is somewhat unclear, so don''t take it literally.  The crack does come all the way to the ledge and is is NOT near the right edge of that wall (there is a lower angle broken system to the right of it that is not likely the intended route).  Climb up the crack and flare, protecting whenever possible to a crux not long before the crack ends.  Step up on lower angle rock and solid /secure holds into an undercling (thin hands) roof.  Place gear on long slings and work out right on that roof to the edge, then over it, and back sharply left to a good belay ledge.  There is an excellent body-sized horn of rock to belay from on a cordalette, almost directly below the bolts of the next pitch.  If you do not have any drag after negotiating the roof below, you could probably just continue on P3.... P3 (5.8, 90'): Climb up and right and then step left to clip the first bolt 6 meters up (5.5). Do another easy move or two (5.5) to reach and clip the second bolt before doing the crux moves of this pitch in the area of the 3rd bolt (5.8).  Go slightly right and up to a more distant 4th bolt (long sling) before heading left and up a crack and flake system to a good ledge.  Optional gear, mostly medium cams, can protect the flake, which is easy terrain (5.4?).  Go slightly right on the ledge to a solid belay on a very large horn of rock. P4 & P5 (link these) (5.9, 200'):  From the belay, you will see an NULLarchNULL of a flake above you like a tall, narrow doorway.  There are two options.  Go left from the belay up its left side and left past 2 bolts of face climbing (5.9), then back right to merge with the rest of the line, or go right and around a vague corner passing a fixed pin before placing solid gear and coming back left around a corner (5.8). Both options merge in a moderate, common crack system (5.5-5.7 mostly) with good holds, good rests, and good gear.  It is however a little scruffy.  Follow your instincts to stay on the line even though it is not entirely clear.  After 190', you will reach a sloping ledge.  At the back of that ledge is a large, solid belay tree slightly to the left.  To the right, there are a pair of more scraggly looking trees.  Between the two lies the next pitch, which is both the crux and the best on the route. P6 (5.9, 100'): Hubbel''s book is misleading here. Don''t look for the bolts as shown on this pitch, because they are not where they are shown.  Look for an inset of rock back to the right of the belay tree.  The inset if about 6 meters wide and is a solid face. To the left is a right-facing corner with some OW terian potential, which is not the route, but is within reach.  An intermittent crack just right of this gives way to good face climbing and 5 bolts, the first of which is 10+ meters up; they are not very visible from below.  Climb the face just left of center above the ledge (5.7, protected by a spotter) to a good stance and place gear, now a body-length above the ledge.  An intermittent crack can be used for holds and protection for this climbing (more 5.6-5.7).  Eventually the climb will become more vertical and several #4-#7 stopper placements will be available. Place a few and head up and slightly right to the first of 5 bolts.  The crux moves (5.9, thin) are protected by these stoppers, so check them good.  Climb past the first bolt into sustained 5.9- moves for a little bit, then up on gradually easing difficulty to the top.  The bolting here is far from sparse and the bolts are good.

Shrouded in a haze of rye aged stoke, Bulleit Train was established ground-up roughly over 8 days across 3 years. Located about 500 vertical feet below Shock Treatment, Bulleit Train climbs 8 pitches of half crack, half slab up the steep north face of Big Rock Candy Mountain. Pitches 5-8 have some of the best rock quality in the SPlatte. If you’re a face climber, we highly recommend this climb! It truly has something for everyone: undercling roofs, heel hooks, stem corners, slab, and easy OW. This climb is currently listed as #4 “Big Aid Route A2” in the Haas guidebook as an unfinished aid climb. Evidence of previous parties was found as high as pitch 3. Please let me know if you started it, as I reached out to many of the SPlatte regulars and could not find who did. The route can be rappelled with a 70m rope, or continue to the top by climbing into pitch 9 of Rotten Teeth . The grades are suggested, we welcome feedback. P1: 12- Rising, undercling traverse (1/5 for the beginning, 4/5 stars for the rest). 6 bolts + gear, 25m. Climb 15 feet of bad rock. I recommend stickclipping the first bolt (a 0.75 or 1 fits in the first pod if you prefer not to use the sticks we left at the base). After the 15 feet of crumbles, traverse out right clipping bolts and intermittent gear. Eventually you’ll come to the traverse''s end, then climb the awesome, hanging handcrack. After 20 feet, look left for the anchors. They are guarded by an 8 foot 5.9 slab traverse that''s more heady for follower than leader. P2: 12- Heel Hook in the SPlatte? (3/5 stars). 1 bolt + gear, 18m. Channel your inner Clear Creek wankster, clip a bolt, and perform some pretty powerful moves off the belay. If you’ve somehow held on, ready yourselves with your microcams for a short but technical 11 finger crack. Finish the pitch with glory wide hands, looking for the anchors left on a small stance. P3: 5.9+ Cowboy Traverse (2.5/5 stars). 2 bolts (old), 30m. Start up a fun, dual finger crack that ends too shortly. The leader will then most likely channel their inner 5.9+, wide climber in the...well wide, semi-awkward crack. The glory of a toprope will allow the follower to mostly stem and slab their way up the face. Find an old anchor, and keep going! Traverse the wide gorge left. Don’t feel ashamed if you throw a leg up and over the ledge while you traverse for the cowboy up experience. Truth be told, I groveled through the far back reminiscent to the womb fight pitch of Maiden Voyage in The Black!

We tried real hard to find a way around this pitch, but the climbing above (pitches 5-8) deemed forging through necessary. This pitch isn’t great (1/5 stars). Climb a vegetated corner up to a vertical dihedral. Climb through occasional good handjam to choss to handjam. Yes...we bolted a crack… but it seemed like whippers on this pitch may rip out parts of said crack, so enjoy the 3 bolts. ***You''ll notice a beautiful handcrack flake up and right off the belay. We tried to make this go. The start is crumbly, and the handcrack awesome. There are bolts above this pitch. In order to connect back into P5, it would involve probably 12+/13- friction slabbin'. It''s all yours if you want to put in the work! P5: 5 bolts, 23m (4/5 stars). Good microcams off the belay set the leader up for the start of the slab adventure! Consider this pitch a warm-up for what''s to come! Climb up the groove protected by bolts eventually leading to a decent run to a jug. Gear can be found around the arete to take the spice out of the runout (0.1 - 0.2 size). Continue up 5.8 jugs, and traverse right to the belay on a sloping ledge. P6: 12- Rainbow Trout Traverse (5/5 stars). 9 bolts, 20m. Climb straight up off the belay into the corner protected by bolts. Place a cam high in the corner, and start your journey rightwards (we tried going up straight up the dihedral but hit really crappy crappy crappy crappy rock - not recommended, but there are anchors up there). Undercling the crack while pasting your feet on the slab. Every 4-5 feet there are good underclings to be found if my giant tickmarks have faded. Pull up into the corner, and finally find an ok rest below a gently rising roof. Slab and roof climb all at the same time, pulling the roof on the far right side. It is helpful to unclip the last bolt to reduce drag while bringing up your second. Enjoy the fun, hanging belay. P7: 5.12 The Guardian Slab (5/5 stars). 12 bolts, 32m. While your belayer enjoys that hanging belay, start climbing up 5.8/5.9 fun slab up and left. After bolt 4, things become progressively harder. Pray that someone before you has ticked the holds, because an onsight of this slab would be impressive. Let me know, and I’ll happily buy you a beverage of your choice! Continue up and left slabbin' your way to glory! It’s a really cool position with a steep plunge below the arete to the left. If you’re feeling peachy, combine with the next pitch, if not (like us), stop at the belay. This pitch comes into the sun around 1:30 to 2:00 p.m. in the summer. P8: 5.9ish?

This is what I have to say: this route is far and away the most unique climb that I''ve ever had the fun to (partially) experience.  I would love to hear more about it from others who''ve been there, so I will submit a description here in hopes that others will also rave about the route.  This climb is awesome, no doubt about it.  The loose rock and a bit of grunge and munge give way to superb climbing up a perfectly cleaved dihedral for several pitches on bullet hard rock.  Instead of following a splitter crack or something straightforward, the route veers this way and that, following weakness, which is not found in the corner itself.  The thing that makes this route so...interesting...is that even with all the modern trinkets, you are forced to rely on rusty quarter inch bolts and pitons...most of which are protruding out a good ways.  The climbing is steep and hard and tying them off might be a bit of a challenge if you''re trying to free it.  In some cases, it''s impossible to back up the sketchy fixed pro.  The belays themselves feature creative combinations of antiquated protection, so bring some stuff to back it up! The first pitch deals with loose rock and poor protection...it might be considered NULLRNULL as potential to hurt yourself definitely exists.  The crux is delicate face climbing, well above fixed gear.  My partner winged off on this pitch when both handholds he was holding broke, sending him for a 20 footer (onto a 1/4NULL bolt!).  As I caught the fall, fist-sized chunks of rock ripped through the foliage around me.  Yikes!  As he is a bold fellow, he combined the first sketchy pitch with the next pitch, which was more elegant and even harder, climbing past overhanging rock on big holds with thin protection. The third (or second) pitch is beautiful and hard.  Most of the gear consists of fixed pitons with the eye about 2'' away from the rock.  Very steep, it works its way up thin cracks on an arete with awkward positions and pumpy sections, until finally a belay appears in the dihedral. The next pitch heads out right, past a quarter inch bolt, and past some more fixed gear that is out of view.  Our team aborted when my partner flew past the belay, ripping out a #1 knifeblade and was caught...again by a 1/4NULL bolt...the only thing between him and the belay (which was spinning 1/4NULL bolt, backed by a Black Alien and RPs, along with that bomber sideways-pounded nut).  Yes, we were scared. I''d like to continue with the description, but I can't.  I can only guess that the next pitch was steep and hard, on good rock, protected by more knifeblades. And supposedly the last pitch is only 5.8...on SHALE! If you try this route, be strong...I''d like to think someone could hang in there and replace that knifeblade that my partner pulled and restore the integrity of the route.  I do hope that whatever happens, people don''t go up there and replace all the sketchy pro with conveniently placed bomber bolts...because then this masterpiece of climbing would be irrevocably changed...dumbed down, if you will, to a semi-ordinary climb that you could go anywhere to experience.

Pitch 1 (5.4): start at the base area of the original Mitten Slab route. Climb up and slightly left on easy terrain to the first bolt that is 15-20 feet up. Continue up on low angle terrain with good patina edges, passing three more bolts. At the fourth bolt, the angle steepens, and you can climb up and left or straight up to a good stance. A few more easy moves brings you to a 2-bolt chain anchor underneath the large overhang that runs across the lower face of the Mitten Slab. 4 bolts, ~ 80 feet. Pitch 2 (5.10+): climb up and right from the anchor to reach the first bolt. Alternatively, you can climb directly above the anchor and place gear before traversing right to reach the first bolt although this should be unnecessary for most. After clipping the first bolt, move your feet high to clip the second before pulling the first crux on the steepest climbing on the pitch. Easier climbing via pockets on dark rock is encountered for the next three bolts before getting into a second, albeit slightly easier, crux on small, sharp crimpers. After the last bolt, the climbing difficulty eases, and you can climb straight up on the face or go for the corner crack system on the right where you can place an optional cam (1-1½ cam). Follow the corner as it arches up and left at a small stance and a 2-bolt, vertically oriented chain anchor. 6 bolts and optional cam, ~80 feet. Pitch 3 (5.7): climb above the anchor via dish features on good, dark rock with the first bolt about 10-12 feet up. A second bolt is encountered above before moving left into a corner feature that has several bushes in it. Place gear in the crack, and look up and left for a live pine tree on a ledge that cuts across the wall. Thats what youre aiming for. The anchor is on that ledge, about 40 feet right of the tree. After placing gear in the crack, traverse left and slightly up for about 15 feet of easy climbing (5.5) to a horizontal crack where good gear can be found. Directly above another 10 feet is another bolt. Clip the bolt and move left. You can go up at the bolt and then left or you can climb down slightly before moving left. Either way, aim for a small scoop of rock. A hollow sounding crack is to the left. You can place gear here before moving up to clip another bolt just below a sloping ledge with a 2 bolt chain anchor. 4 bolts, ~100 feet. Pitch 4 (5.7): Start a few feet left of the anchor and pull up on to good holds. The first bolt is about 10 feet up but the hardest move is getting started on the face. After clipping the first bolt, continue up on good features, clipping two more bolts. After the third bolt traverse left along a horizontal seam and gain a small right facing flake feature. Place gear in this crack and climb up the face and on to a large pinnacle of rock where the next 2 bolt chain anchor is found. 3 bolts and gear. ~80 feet. Pitch 5 (5.8): the first bolt is just right of the anchor and protects the first moves of the pitch. Tall people may reach it from a stance to the right of the anchor, but shorter climbers may want to pre-clip this bolt and their rope while aiding off the anchor. Climb up and right from this first bolt. More gear is found to the right before moving up and clipping the second bolt. Here, youll pull left into a flake feature and follow the crack as it angles up and right for 15 feet. Place good gear, and pull left at the base of a large balloon feature. The balloon feature is a large, hollow sounding flake that looks like a balloon. A bolt was placed to the left of this flake, because the security of cams was seriously doubted. Climb the flake, and go straight up from the top of it. Look around for creative gear placements before finding the next bolt. Climb up and left to the fifth and final bolt. From here, traverse straight left 8 feet to a two bolt anchor at a stance or you can climb straight above the final bolt to link into the next pitch. 6 bolts and gear, ~100 feet. Pitch 6 (5.10a): climb up and right for 40 feet, linking together a series of solid crack features. Save a 2 cam for the top of the final crack and climb up the steepening face to the first bolt. From here, pull a series of technical moves involving crimps and underclings for the final crux of the climb. Five closely spaced bolts protect this section, and careful balance on good feet can offer good rest between the hardest bits. After the last bolt, climb up to the diving board feature. A 1½ cam protects the initial moves on to the diving board, and a larger cam like a #4 Camalot can offer closer security for the final moves. At the top of the diving board is a ample legde with a 2-bolt chain anchor. 5 bolts and gear, ~100 feet. Pitch 7 (5.7): a creative cam placement gets you started just off the belay to the left. Continue up, clipping three bolts followed by numerous gear placements that protect the rest of the climb as the angle gradually lessens. Angle slightly right near the top to find the 2-bolt anchor. 3 bolts and gear, ~ 100 feet. Illusions was established all ground up.

This is OK because as the cracks thins out the feet and face holds start becoming more plentiful on the right wall. Eventually things disappear entirely, and you are forced to make some mandatory gymnastic/dynamic moves past a fixed anchor to clear the blank corner (the crux 5-7' was originally aided on blades - it might be doable now on aid with some micro wires and a hammer), this gets you back into some wide hands. Move left to a decent belay ledge and some solid anchors, 5.12 or 5.10 C1/2, 130'+/-. P2. Ascend the chimney. Once you get up in it proper (scary), there''s a crack deep inside to keep gravity at bay.

Don''t plug your cams in your finger locks, 5.11R or 5.9R C1 100'+/-. -- With a few bolts through the outer lip of the chimney, this pitch would be really fun. Right now it''s a dark scary voyage into a belly full of choss and gigantic spiders! P3. Avoid the huge gash by heading up and left into a sweet corner on bullet hard stone on mostly fist-size cams.

Pitch 3: climb out right, and pull over a bulge keeping it together until gear is acquired. I put a number 3 in some peg, and it might slow you down before it blows. Climb an easy groove to another steep, little crack which I climbed on the right in the middle of the feature putting you on a ledge where you can build a belay on the left of a dirty, left-facing corner behind a small solid flake. This is where we changed route from the original path of Way Of The Ancients, as they went out left in this pitch but eventually had to climb a 180’ traversing hand crack back which sounded less-than-ideal, and climbing in this fashion allows you to slab the super fun, runout 5.6 pitch on perfect pegmatite. Pitch 4: climb up a dirty, left-facing corner and then onto the easy but super fun, runout, pegmatite slab. This is well worth the detour from the original pitch in my opinion. We belayed on the left side of ledge under a roof. Pitch 5: from the belay, move out right and climb the left angling crack that ends too soon. Then climb dirt cracks to a large ledge moving the belay as far right as possible. Pitch 6: climb up the easy chimney system out right to the top of the pinnacle. Traverse the ridge of formation with simul-climbing till you are at the notch between the fin and the next wall, and downclimb 4th Class into a notch. Pitch 7: climb the face to the fun, vertical, hand crack on a bulge. Mantel up onto good holds, and climb slab above right-angling crack till on top of a large ledge. Pitch 8: scramble into alcove on the right, and climb the left-angling layback finger crack till you are under the giant, orange, triangular roof. Turn the roof on the right, and belay on right hand side of ledge under an obvious, bushy crack. Pitch 9: scramble up a vegetated corner to a short, little, boulder problem taking you into a corner and onto the ridge line above. Coil your ropes, and walk ridge line till the final wall on the formation. Pitch 10: either climb the wide crack or go around right side of ledge, and climb quartz steps to gain a crack around the corner. Once again coil your ropes, and walk on the right side of an island until a gully is reached. Climb down this gully, and look across notch to the next gully locating the easy corner and chimney system. Downclimb exposed 4th Class to the base of corner system. Pitch 11: climb up the easy corner system to the top of the final island, and coil your ropes. Walk across the top of this island, and do one more exposed 4th Class downclimb into a gully. Cut across hillside, and do a short jaunt upwards to rim proper.', 'Go down the Chillumstone Gully. I recommend rapping on your own rope, as the current fixed rope has 3 or 4 core shots to pass and is stiff as rebar. After the rap, traverse through the landslide wash to reach the big ledge.

Continue up on sustained climbing passing another bolt.  Once above the pegmatite band, traverse left toward the arete to a small ledge/stance with a bolt. The bolt is for the belay and can be backed up with small cams.  Gear: lots of small cams up to a #2 Camalot, stoppers, and runners. Pitch 6 (5.11) - Climb the seam with thin gear to a bolt on the arete.  Then move right to a shallow, left-facing corner with a seam and follow it to a big ledge.

('Open Minded', '5.12c', 'PG', false, false, false, false, false, false, 'Matt Lisenby and Chris Righter', 'This route is the culmination of Arrow Minded and Narrow Minded. Back in the '80s, John Kaandorp and Steve Demaio put up Arrow Minded, 5.9 A2, which basically goes up the left side of the large arrow feature but dead ends at the apex. There is evidence that they also attempted the right side of the arrow feature, given that there is a bail anchor halfway up on the right side. Enter the late 2000s, Bryan Gilmore began working on a complete free variation. He rappelled in mini-traxioning and cleaning the upper pitches above the apex of the arrow roof. He made one attempt at freeing the upper pitches with Steve House and ultimately ended up only redpointing the top 3 pitches. Due to having to move out of state and being short on time, he never ended up scoping out the pitches below the apex of the arrow or completing the entire line. Open Minded is a completion of Gilmore''s original vision. It goes directly up the OW on the right side of the arrow feature (marked NO! in Zeilman''s NULLThe BlackNULL guide) and joins into Narrow Minded at the apex of the roof. Technically Arrow Minded has not been freed, since it goes up the left side of the arrow.   All said and done, it''s a 2 star route with a couple 3 star pitches. Check out Vic Zeilman''s awesome guidebook NULLThe BlackNULL for more info and topos. Pitches: 1. Go up easy, chossy, 5.6ish corners to a large ledge with a massive boulder on it, 100 feet (no stars). 2. (12-) Start in the OW on the left side of the ledge. It starts off with a couple awkward OW moves then quickly becomes a 5.10 hand and fist crack up to a bombay roof with an old bail anchor. From here, wiggle your way into the steep OW, and blue collar your way to the anchor at the apex of the arrow, 115 feet (3 stars). 3. (12c ish) Pull through the cool roof at the apex of the arrow, which quickly turns into a hand crack. Then traverse right on good hand jams to a vertical finger crack. Get a good rest, then go up the finger crack, clip a fixed nut, and fight the pump on the traverse out right that ends on a large ledge around the arete. Save a #3 for the first traverse and a #2 cam for the second traverse. This pitch is a bit dirty, 110 feet (1.5 stars). 4. (12-) Go up easy OW passing a small river of bird poo to a steep finger crack layback. Do a couple hard pulls past a fixed nut to a large hand rail, then go up the chimney to the top of the tower, 100 feet (2 stars). 5. (5.12) Go up layback flake to a sloping hand rail traverse then up again through bouldery thin face to a large ledge. This is the best pitch on the route, 70 feet (3 stars). 6. (5.11) Climb solid peg past a couple bolts to roof, clip another bolt, then climb left, then go up on sloping holds to a good flake just above the next roof. Then head up and right to the top.

Part of South Chasm View Wall is closed due to a 300' x 40' slab of rock that shifted one inch in one week. The slab is estimated to weigh 6 million pounds or more. The NPS is consulting with geohazards specialists for further direction. See nps.gov/blca/planyourvisit/… for updates. This route starts out with 4 pitches of clean crack climbing on beautiful rock with a good, built-in warmup. That is followed by a heady, thin .11+ R pitch with big fall potential on fairly steep slab. After this pitch, wild traverses, burly and spicy technical corner climbing, perfect cracks in flakes and corners, and a mega-stout overhung, left-leaning, flared crux tips splitter will give you a good whoopin'. Climb this route at your own risk! P1. Climb a left-facing corner with some blocks and the occasional bush up to a ledge. (9) This is the original start for the Flakes, just to the left of the commonly used start for that route, and two lines left of the Astrodog splitter variation. P2. Climb two opposing corners on mostly fingers and stemming on clean rock. (10-) Pull over a couple bulges past some old tat anchors and belay on a ledge. P3. Proceed up a thin splitter that widens into thin hands perfect rock. (10-) Exit left on a ledge and climb a shallow, thin hands, left-facing corner on more incredible granite. Scramble up and left onto a ledge below a finger crack and huge offwidth (9). P4. Do not climb the finger crack (although it is fun!) nor the offwidth above it (200+ feet, 5.12). Instead, skirt left around the finger crack block, traverse some face (10+ PG-13), and pull into a hanging left-leaning, right facing fingers corner with black streaks (11 or easier). Climb up with good fingers locks and good feet. Traverse left to the bolt (11 PG-13), clip it, and climb up to the next bolt, clip it, then lower down to the first bolt (recommended to avoid a factor-2 fall onto the anchor). Not redirecting through the bolt makes the start of the next pitch, 5.11 R. P5. Start up the slab with a pre-clipped bolt (11) or sketch up to the bolt (11 R). Run it out quite a bit up to some very thin gear up thin slab (11 R) going mostly straight up. Continue up to some gear placements (10), then fire off a balancy and thuggy crux traverse across a sloping rail trending left (11+). P6. Climb up some licheny and somewhat questionable rock (10 PG-13) to a small arete with a piton just to the left. Clip the piton, traverse left to clip a bolt, and then pull hard, thin slab moves with terrible feet left to the corner using your best ninja beta (12). Fall into the corner, and traverse the hanging flake left and down runnering all gear placements to keep the rope away from the sharp edge(burly 11). Arrange your last gear low for your follower, then either downclimb down and left (11+) or jump (11) to a small, sloping, leaning ledge. Climb up an unprotected corner and plug a piece before a small sloping stance. Run it out as much as possible to try to protect your follower. Downclimbing to the sloping ledge is 11/11+ R for the follower. Get ready to start running if you blow it so you don''t take a huge, cheesegrating swing. P7. This was the sketchiest pitch. Do not fall until you get to bomber gear in the hanging corner, lest you rip gear and deck on the slab below. The gear down lower looks questionable at best. Climb up a vague corner (11+/12- PG-13/R) with gear placements in brittle rock. Place as much gear as you can to keep you off the deck, then commit to slabbing into a hanging, hard right-leaning corner. Tech, stem, and burl your way through the corner (12-/12), climb down and right on some hands and liebacks, and pull into a steep, right facing corner on beautiful, if somewhat lichenous, rock for almost 100 feet (9+). P8. Climb up flakes (9) and easy slab up and right to the base of a steep, thin, left-leaning splitter on dark rock. If aiding (I did), continue up the splitter (12+ or A0). If not, set a belay and climb the hard, overhanging, flared tips crack. Med/large nuts, offset nuts, small cams, and offset cams are useful for protecting this beast. I pulled out a shaky piton with bodyweight, freeing up a key foothold. Belay on a bushy ledge. P9. Make a sketchy unprotected mantel off the belay onto a small ledge (10+ R), then teeter up around an arete onto a sloping stance on an overhanging wall. Garden out some finger locks and gear placements, then fire off a burly mantle move up and onto a sloping ledge (12-/12). This sequence felt like V4/V5 to me with dirt in my eyes from cleaning out the crack. Climb up some easy slab and up a juggy flake to the base of a crack in a lovely flake. Clip a fixed nut, maybe fire another piece in, and make a reachy move up to a bomber finger lock (hard 11+). Climb up a juggy, handcrack flake to a slab (9), then run it out up the slab (8 R) to a stance at the base of an arching corner. Save some rattly finger sized gear or big nuts for the belay. P10. From here, we couldn''t find the last two pitches of Jonathan''s route, so we proceeded to exit via the easiest escape. Climb up a somewhat dirty broken corner (10), escape right when possible, and continue up a slab/groove/open book system up to a peg chimney through a roof. Climb an easy ramp to the right of the chimney and belay. P11. Walk a ledge right for a ropelength to the skyline. These pitches constitute the Astrodog escape pitches: P12. Climb up blocks and handcracks (10ish) and up some easy slabs to a comfy belay. P13. Climb up easy slabs, pull a bulge (9) to the right of a roof, continue up more easy slab, and then climb a fun chockstone chimney (9+) with chockstones and nuts for pro.

Once down from the raps, continue down the couloir to the top of a large boulder with a massive splitter up its face. The splitter faces the river. Start up a chimney system from the top of the boulder. Pitch 1. This is basic Black Canyon climbing of a 5.9 chimney. Belay at the base of a V-slot corner, 60m. Pitch 2.

There is a way to walk to and from this gully, but getting lost is the most likely outcome from the effort. However, if you need to walk out from this area, it''s possible by walking to the top of the gully (base of the rappels), crossing the col to the other side and descending about 50 feet. Then begin looking for a ledge system that leads up a bit and way right (5.6 ish). If you pass this ledge system and keep heading downhill, the climbing to gain the proper exit gully gets longer and harder, so find it.  At the end (right side) of this system, you gain another gully that allows you to go up.

At this point, it had rained, so we had early lunch on top of the pillar waiting for the rock to dry. P4 . Follow a short handcrack up into some precarious flakes, and place gear under a roof. Bust left out the side of the roof (10-), continue briefly left, then climb up and right to a rail on the bottom of the peg traverse. Now climb up and hard right on mostly good edges, getting a tiny cam or two along the way. Traverse to a sloping stance with hand-sized gear (10- R). P5 . Climb up a smooth, featured, left-facing corner on varnished reddish-brown rock. Get a #4 in out left, then pull over a small roof into the corner up higher (11 PG-13). Arrange small brass trinkets and make a big move to a juggy rail (10+ R). Traverse right to the arete (9) and place gear on the left side in a crack. Move up slightly and then traverse directly right for 25-30 feet (10+ R) with no more gear until the next left-facing corner. Run it out up the corner (10-) to protect the follower. Build a belay at the top of the corner. P6 . Climb up a discontinuous, somewhat poopy, finger crack (11) with great rock and good stances. When the crack ends, traverse left on positive holds (9 R). Climb up another corner (10ish) and arrange gear (include finger size and C4 #4). From here, the FA claims the route traverses low and right on edges (11 R) and then up towards a hanging flake and a slopey mantel onto a ledge. This way takes some small offset cams but appeared to blank out below the flake. I downclimbed over to another variation, but perhaps this way goes. Direct Variation: Rather than moving out right on the face, continue up the crack as it peters out to a seam, liebacking the right edge of a bottoming crack on perfect rock, looking for a good face hold up high (11 R). A 0.75 C4 or red Metolius cam can be arranged in a shallow but bomber placement slightly out right in a parallel feature. Run it out 20-25 feet above this to a precarious mantel (12- PG-13/R) onto a very sloping rail below a small peg band, clipping an ancient bolt (really a bent masonry nail). A slopey undercling hold and a high foot smear make this move possible. Make a very delicate traverse directly right across the sloping rail (11 R), finishing on a slab below a roof. Pull the roof (10+) on hands, cups, and fists, and either belay at a good stance (good gear) or continue up a beautiful varnished corner on rattly fingers (11) to small stance with smaller gear. This exciting variation seems to be of higher quality than some potentially flaky rock at the top of Jonathan''s variation. We watched another climber go this way as well. If this becomes the standard variation, someone should definitely put a good bolt here! Blowing the mantel and ripping the cam below could be devastating. P7 . This was the most dangerous pitch in terms of likelihood to fall and get hurt. Climb the varnished (11) corner (or if belaying above it), continue up discontinuous crack and face, angling slightly left. Now climb run-out face, arranging gear where possible, and climb delicate and friable edges (11 R/X) way above gear. After the most difficult moves, slot in some shaky brass nuts and marginal cams, and make easier moves to better gear. Jay led this pitch, and we both thought it was pretty dangerous.

Climb up a good, unprotected peg band up and left (10+ X), following the path of least resistance. The FA claims to have gone further left, but I climbed slightly right and up, eventually getting gear after 60-70 feet (tiny cams including 000 C3). Meander up and left on schist and peg, placing gear where possible. (10 R) Build a belay at the first good crack worth putting gear into. P9 .

After cleaning and top roping the top 3 pitches, we were so impressed with their quality that we felt committed to connect the dots with similar climbing from the bottom to the top. The route has an undulating feel to it, with transitions between a few lower-angle sections to mostly vertical and some overhanging panels. The rock is quite solid for the most part and sustained, with 10 of 12 pitches in the 10+/11 range. We took pretty good care w/ cleaning, so there shouldn’t be many surprises, but being The Black and all, there are no guarantees. We both felt this is a good route providing sustained, difficult climbing on generally very good and steep rock. The route breaks up nicely into 4 groups of pitches, with a good ledge after every third pitch. There is a nice bivi ledge at the top of pitch 6 which has hosted some fine dining and iced adult beverages, so don''t miss out on this if you have the time. At the top of the route, work NE (left) about 75 yards to the road. Parking at the Big Island overlook (upriver from the descent gully) means the shortest walk to the car at the end of the climb. As of May, 2016, the route waits for a second party to make an ascent as well as a single day ascent, although it was climbed by Murphy and Bohanon in a continuous ground up 30-something hour push (with an unplanned 5-hour bivi at the top of pitch 9) in the fall of 2011.  Terry Murphy has led all of the pitches in very good style on at least 2 occasions in 2011 and 2012. Below are some brief descriptions of each pitch. Route finding can be tricky, so get a good idea of where you''ll be going by taking a look with binoculars from the Balanced Rock overlook. P1. Climb this bushy intro - the same pitch as Death Camas Dihedrals, but it stops just short of pillar’s top, 8/9, comfy ledge. P2. Climb 5.10 out left and up off the belay to low angle ‘chute’ then hard left to a steep face, 10, 2 bolts, comfy ledge. P3. It is steep right off the belay (bolt protected to prevent a fall onto the belay ledge), then you get great climbing on black rock until the slab exit to 1st ledge, 11-, 1 bolt, spacious ledge. P4. This pitch is long and fun and starts well to the left of the top of pitch 3. You need #0.75 cam at the belay (pin), which has an uncomfy stance, 11-, 3 bolts. P5. This is one of the harder pitches on the route, and it works up and slightly left on small features and cracks along a mostly left facing shallow dihedral, 11. The gear is a fixed pin, wires. You need a #3 and 3.5 cam for the belay, a comfy stance. P6. This is another hard and very cool pitch. Move up and slightly right to a prominent roof which is pulled on the right side, then continue up difficult climbing to a huge ledge about half way up the route(5-11-,PG-13). There is an optional, scruffy 5.8 exit to the left up a loose gully that avoids the hard climbing on this pitch. Belay on huge second ledge (the Veranda). P7. This is an excellent pitch – gently overhanging 5.11 face climbing for first 20+m.  The start if this pitch is well to the right of the top of P6, but still left of the arete.  There is a block/pedestal that marks the start, or one can also start about 10 feet right of the pedestal, and the line generally follows black streaks more or less straight up. We have always started at the same point on the Veranda, but initially drifted right out to the arete (hard to miss it!, 5.9, Sept. ’11).  Ultimately, we really liked the ‘direct’ line up the black streaks (5.10, May ’12) as shown in the topo. Either way, both are very good. You get a comfy, grassy stance with a small bush. P8. Take a ride on The Pegway – a cool but short feature. 9. You get a comfy seat for the belay out left of the dihedral about 30 feet above the end of the pegway.  This pitch is definitely NULLRNULL rated without the fixed #3 Loweball at the end of the Pegway and NULLPG-13NULL with it. P9. It is a bit spooky getting to the roof exit with some devious protection. The move out the right side of the roof is easier than it looks, 10, comfy ledge. P10. This has a boulder-problem crux that is bolt protected then a fun hand traverse right along the peg band to a left-facing dihedral that is ascended about 20 feet, 11-, 1 bolt, comfy stance. P11. Climb some scruff to start as one continues up the left-facing dihedral (5.9 PG-13), then move slightly left for steep/solid/strenuous fun that works up through amazing golden overhanging rock. This has a nice position, 11-, comfy stance. P12. This pitch stays steep and follows the crack system to the top. It also has a very nice position.

That being said, it is The Black, game on, be prepared for some loose, scary, and run out climbing, just not at the hardest grades on the route. Also be prepared for a long day with lots of pitches.  The topo is plenty adequate, but I will provide some descriptions-pitch lengths are on the topo.  My partner and I did a lot of 'sub par' alpine style belays-one or two pieces, belaying off your harness - you are not always building a huge anchor and belaying off of it. P1. 5.9. Climb an easy crack up the right side of a pillar in a right-facing corner to its top. Look for the shitty, fixed, baby angle (loose) which is more a trail marker.  Good gear near by, and face climb (a little run) up and right over the bulge to a good belay ledge P2. 5.9.

This is a fun pitch with an annoying belay in the chimney with some flaky rock. P6. 5.7. This would be the easiest pitch to get lost on, I did.  Continue up the chimney and ramp til its end.  Traverse right, then go up a right-facing feature for about 5 meters.  At this point, you are probably 25-30m out from the belay.  You will look up to some broken features in the 'black grotto' and even some fixed tat hanging off the roof-this is NOT the way.  Look right and down and you will see a massive, hanging, left-facing corner and roof - step over the corner to get on the ramp that would be the top of this feature.

A fixed pin you climb up to will blaze the way a little bit as you work your way to some right-facing features.  Keep climbing out of sight of your belayer till you get to a good ledge belay with 2 fixed pins. P8. 5.11-. The crux is off the belay protected by a bolt.  Pull through some steep overlaps, and then climb easily to another massive ledge. P9. 5.9. Follow topo, belay on block-tight little belay for 2 people-finger-size pieces and nuts for belay. P10. 5.11-. This is another fun pitch off by yourself as you can''t see your belayer. Belay on a small ledge at the top of the groove-corner feature.  I think there was a fixed pin. P11. 5.8 (R?). The pitches get short for a bit here. This is a peg pitch with a bolt - wow that''s nice. It is easy climbing on good rock, I don''t know if it''s really R, but don''t fall.  Get on to another massive ramp and go up and left on 4th class til you see the next pitch with its bolt. P12. 5.10. This is a short crux protected by the bolt, don''t blow it after that.

Clip it, climb the crux, and use face holds to climb the sides of the OW, because who wants to climb an OW anyway?  Belay on the pedestal. P15. 5.10.

I soloed the route w/o rope so I cannot comment on how the route would accept pro, but it looked like there are many places to place gear (cams/nuts etc.).

The route can not be sewn up, but something is usually available within 10 feet. It only feels run out just below the major horizontal ramp, halfway up, coming out of a corner and over a bulgy slab. There are many belay ledges to choose from. If necessary, you can bail just under half way up, via a large, horizontal ramp. You can easily walk off the slab at the top of the climb. The rock quality is pretty good on this route, and the slab is surprisingly clean considering it gets little traffic, but the lack of traffic means that holds are not tested, and loose rocks are not cleaned on a regular basis. There are places where the surface is exfoliating, so double check your feet on the slabby sections.', 'Directions to Sisters Rock are given on the Sisters Rock page.

Has it been climbed before? Probably, but the public documentation is nonexistent. At any rate, there is now just barely enough gear that maybe it will get climbed often enough that it will not drift back into obscurity. In 2012, there have been almost a half dozen new routes. This particular route in this local genre of NULLchossinerringNULL should/could have more ice than many of the other new routes. It is also unique in that the ascensionists invested in bomber rap anchors. The rock quality in the first three pitches is pretty good (for the area) and gets worse up high, but as a general rule if the climbing is hard, the rock is pretty good as well as the protection. Pitch 1. From the horizontal trail at base of wall, follow the gully up 40 feet to the start of the real climbing. There is a wet start and a dry start. If you are lucky and there is ice, you will see a mossy start covered in a bit of ice, M5. If it''s dry, choose the dry start ten feet to the left, in the decomposing yellow cake with the intermittent crack. It takes small cams and perhaps a tied off ice tool, D5. This first step in the first pitch is 30 feet. At its top is a horizontal crack on left wall. You are now deep in the gully and only halfway up pitch one. If you belay here, you can enjoy a nice seated belay to watch your partner climb the (low) crux of the route at M6. Follow the crack on the right hand side of the gully. When the gully narrows a bit, the left wall will have better gear. Look for three bolt anchor up right. This bomber stance might be in the line of fire. On the first ascent of the first pitch, in early December of 2011, the author was at the very steepest part of the pitch, which overhangs a little, when, as reported by belayer Frank Robertson, an avalanche came down and nearly ripped him from the wall. If he had been 15 feet higher at the choke point of the gully.... Frank said the avalanche was 5 feet high as it came through the choke point. Pitch 2. Step left off stance and head up steepening gully. If wet, it could have ice and snow top to bottom,WI4 or perhaps detatched and nearly unprotectable as Noah McKelvin found it in January 2012, that might be M5. If really dry, you get a knifeblade, M5 or D5 or 5.9 and loose. 140 feet. The anchor at the top of this pitch is one of our early ones and our favorite, as it''s a rock bollard, with two separate strands of 10.5 backed up by one bolt...a nice, old school touch. The bolt keeps the ropes from being buried in the snow. Important for those climbing the route in the dead of winter. Keep an eye out for the handy work of our 4 legged friends as the little buggers line their nests with nylon filament. Pitch 3. This pitch has enough bolts to keep you out of the easier gully to the left. Or the even easier variation to the right that Steve House told us Jeff indicated on a photo topo Jeff had chosen.The rock is the best on the whole route, though very compact. You can add to the fixed gear with your own cams and knifeblades. If it''s wet, it''s still unlikely to have much real ice, but maybe you will get lucky, M4. Dry, it''s 5.6, 55 meters. There is a three bolt chain and tree anchor on the right at a stance out of the line of fire. Pitch three has three options. The obvious straight up groove in front of you or the easier gulleys to the left and right. (Edit: We rapped down the whole route in early June of 2014 and the route runs with water and it goes down the center of the three options. Though half of the stream volume drops into the hidden fissures behind pitch three and then emerges again in the gravel on top of pitch two. This might explains why there rarely ever is any ice on pitch three when there is ice on other pitches.) Which of course is where the water that comes all the way from the top of the wall goes. Jeff Lowe told Steve House that he avoided this very steep waterfall variation (directissima) by climbing the right hand variation, which is a broken up ledge and tree filled scramble without any ice. Pitch 4. Climb easy, low angle gully, M3 if wet. Dry it''s 5.0, 50 meters. There is a three bolt belay/rap here; however, after nearly being struck by rockfall on several occasions, there is another safer anchor at same height just 30 feet left. It''s on the edge of the gully. It has one lonely bolt and a nice crack that takes a mid-size cam or two. If it''s wet, you might have to dig for this. Pitch 5. This is the psycho crux. This has been led by Eric Wellborn and Garrett Riegan with little or no gear. Garrett had a large foot hold disintegrate under him, nearly sending him for a ride. If it''s wet, maybe it will be all be frozen together, M4 R. If it''s dry, it is 5.8 R, watch out for exploding holds. The anchor is 55 meters up on left wall of gully. It has three bolts and chain. Pitch 6. In January of 2012, Eric Wellborn and Noah were stopped here. After banging several knife blades in to the rotten rock to build an anchor, Eric Wellborn climbed 20 feet to the get another pin in at the base of the detached ice dagger covering overhanging, mossy, very rotten rock. After pulling off a chunk of rotten rock, he took a 30 foot whipper. Noah sensible decided to avoid the same possible fate even though the climbing for both of them is well within their capabilities. When Garrett, Frank, and I equipped the route, we did the route ground up. Garrett lead pitchs 4 through 8 onsight without anything but a bad cam or nut here or there. He soloed all of pitch 6, but that was in the summer in rock shoes after drinking way too much coffee and Red Bull. If wet, this pitch is WI4-5 M6 R. If dry, it''s 5.9 R. The anchor at the top of pitch 6 is in the far left corner out of the line of fire. 55 meters Pitch 7. Follow gully up and right over yet another step. If wet, this could be snow or ice, M3 R. If dry, it is 5.5 R, 55 meters. Pitch 8. Climb up to trees. Go up one more step of steep rock, though it could be avalanche prone snow. If wet, it is M3 R or steep snow. If dry, it is 5.6 R.

After Phil and I completed Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It years ago, I vowed to never come back. I felt like I couldn''t push harder into M8 X boltless terrain.

He tried to place another one, but the drill ran out of battery. He was then forced to place some not great gear and do an X rated runout to the top on pretty hard terrain. Two bolts were added after this, so no one would have to risk their life again, but still, the pitch is pretty full on. Start with a committing M7/8? traverse left over the void.

P1)  Step up and left around the corner, being careful of loose rock and clip a decent fixed pin.  Above this you can place a high #0.75 Camalot, but then step back down and left for an airy 5.7 traverse move to a good ledge with another piton.  From here, continue traversing up and left along a crack/seam feature with some bushes in it.  You can place a #0.4 Camalot and higher up a #1 Camalot  along this crack (you may even want to sling a bush, although it probably wouldn''t hold).  Continue above the bushes just left of the crack up perfect potholes to the anchor which consists of 1 drilled piton and an old Leeper-Z piton that sticks half way out.  (5.7 R, 130 feet) P2)  Climb above the anchor to the top of a pillar and clip an OK piton.  Continue up on easy but loose terrain past 2 worthless pitons, to a fourth piton which seems a little more solid, but still seems questionable.  From here, you can traverse right to the ridge crest, where you can place a yellow C3 Camalot (1/2NULL).  Then climb the ridge, with another good placement for the #0.4 Camalot to a new 2-bolt anchor at the top of the wall.  You can also climb straight up past the last piton, but a fall here could be tragic.  (5.6 R/X, 130 feet) The X rating in the description is due to the long runouts on the second pitch, with quite worthless protection.  The climbing is easy but very loose and requires a cool head.  If you fall off this pitch, it''s possible that you could rip all the protection (although I hope the first piton would hold).  Falling directly onto the anchor in this scenario could possibly generate enough force to rip the anchor (although I personally think it would hold, but the Leeper-Z makes me wonder).  Similarly, don''t fall prior to clipping the first piton on the first pitch.  The first pitch is also scary and runout, but doesn''t feel quite as sketchy, and at least the anchor at the start of the climb seems bomber.  Either way, long whippers  are a distinct possibility on this climb, and will make you wonder if your protection would hold.  But for those that are ready and willing to take on this type of Garden adventure, the climbing and the position is amazing.', 'This route begins from the large scooped out ledge in the West Face of North Gateway Rock, which is formed by the Tweedle Dum Spire on the south and the main formation of North Gateway Rock to the north.  The scoop is also at the top of Amazing Grace (the hard face climb just left of The Warren Route ). Approach by scrambling up the Tourist Gully almost to its top.  Look for the easiest access to gain the ridge of the rock that is to the west (climber''s left).  There is an obvious notch to look for which is higher than the notch formed by the base of the the Tweedle Dum Spire.  Once you''ve accessed the ridge you have two options.  The original route down-climbs the ridge at 5.4 with limited pro to the saddle below the Tweedle Dum Spire.  From here, you can rappel 60' or so to the large scooped ledge above Amazing Grace (chain anchors - from here you can rappel 150' to the ground).  Alternatively, you may avoid down-climbing the ridge by carefully accessing a 2-pin anchor just below the notch.  This is an exposed maneuver, but leaves a direct 100' rappel down to a two-pin anchor above and to the left of the chain anchors for Amazing Grace.  This is the start of the climb.  (You can also approach by climbing Amazing Grace or the first pitch of Falling From Grace). This route is somewhat tricky in trying to put it in a rational subarea for North Gateway Rock.  It lies on the West face, but the easiest approach is from the Tourist Gully.  Still, it can be approached via The Zipper , The Warren Route , and Amazing Grace.

I believe the anchors on all almost all of the pitches were installed quite a few years ago, likely just to practice rappelling down the east face, but they are still very solid. These anchors are all on a prominent ledge wrapping around the east face, and this has probably been linked up by people just running between anchors for a long time; however, while climbing around top recently, I noticed some shiny glue-ins connecting two anchors (thanks whoever put 'em in!), making the line overall well-protected where the ledge is smaller.
